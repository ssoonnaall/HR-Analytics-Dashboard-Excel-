# 🔍 Data Analysis Approach
##  1.📥 Data Collection
The primary dataset was imported into Excel and stored in the sheet titled “Dataset”. 
## 2.🧹 Data Cleaning and Formatting
To prepare the data for analysis:
-CTRL+T is used to convert selected data into structured table to perform various operations easily
## 3.📊  Data Analysis using Pivot Tables
Several pivot tables were created to explore trends and patterns:
- Attrition by Department, Job Role, and Age Group
- Gender and Education-wise breakdown of attrition
- Count, Sum, and Average formulas in pivot tables
- Calculated fields for:
  - Attrition Rate = (Attrition Count / Total Employees) × 100
  - Average Age of Employees = (Attrition Count / Total Employees)
## 4.📈 Data Visualization
Visuals were built to enhance understanding using:
-Clustered Bar Chart- For Education wise Attrition and Attrition by job role
- Pie and Donut Chart – For department-wise attrition and gender
- Clustered Column Chart – For marital status distribution and attrition by age group
- Slicers – For Education Field, Department and gender 
Charts were linked to pivot tables, updating automatically with data refresh.
## 5. 🖥️ Dashboard Design
The final output was consolidated into the “HR Analytics Dashboard” sheet, combining:
- Visual KPIs
- Interactive charts
- Filters (slicers) for interactivity
The dashboard offers HR stakeholders a quick, clear view of workforce health and attrition trends.
